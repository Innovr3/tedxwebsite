<h2>Sahil Sharma (DJ Zaeden)</h2>

<p>EDM has taken over the lives of the 21st century kids. Everyday a teenager sits in front a laptop and attempts to produce a song of their own but there are very few who have the potential to take it to the next level. Sahil Sharma AKA Zaeden is a Heritage Alumni who made it into the competitive big leagues of electronic music. Being the youngest DJ and music producer to be featured in Tomorrowland alongside Borgeous, he has become a role model to those who were afraid of entering into the exciting field of EDM. Zaeden will inspire you with his story on how he managed to overcome the challenges and fear that he faced on the 26th of August 2016 at the very first TEDx of The Heritage School, Gurgaon.</p>

<h2>Malavath Poorna</h2>

<p>Climbing Mt. Everest is no small task. It takes dedication and patience. It seems like an impossible task to most of us. So how did Malavath Poorna, a 13 year old girl barely able to feed herself end up becoming the youngest woman to climb the indomitable Mount Everest? By working hard and not giving up. On her way to the summit Poorna saw 6 dead bodies.They were bodies of people having the same aspirations as she did. Poorna focused on her goals and when it was the hardest, she hit the refresh button on her line of thought and continued forwards with a rejuvenated sense of determination. Upon reaching the top, she raised the flag of her state Telangana and made her country proud. This is the pinnacle of refreshed thinking and stepping out of one&#39;s comfort zone. Are you ready to follow Poorna on her journey to the world&rsquo;s highest peak?</p>

<h2>Rohit Bansal</h2>

<p>Rohit Bansal cofounded Snapdeal along with his friend Kunal Bahl. What started off as a simple coupon booklet business soon transpired into a multi-billion dollar e-commerce, all with a little bit of vision, passion, and perseverance. They noticed a gap in the Indian marketplace, a gap which they endeavoured to fill after being inspired by other companies from other countries. They took advantage of the emerging technology and started Snapdeal. It was a gamble, as pointed out by their peers and investors, and often it didn&rsquo;t work out how they would have hoped, even leading them to go bankrupt weeks before Rohit&rsquo;s wedding. Yet these were just hurdles on the track which they learnt how to jump over. Come and discover Rohit Bansal&rsquo;s journey and learn how he impacted e-commerce in India and what he learnt along the way.</p>
